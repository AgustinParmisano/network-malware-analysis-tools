# Auto bro conn.log analyzer, labeler and splitter.

### Description:

This scripts uses bro-cut on bro conn.log to get the top 10 ports then creates for each port a flows log file wich are used to create a machine learning test split bro log file with a script called splitter.sh. This generated test split bro log file is later used be the zeek_anomaly_detector python script with uses python pandas to set points to suspicious pre filtered test split bro flows. Finally this script uses a python labaled_dataframe_assigner.py script to set automatic labels to the pre selected test split flows.
The results are written in bro log files per port, the final test_split.log file with the splitted flows for machine learning test and a csv file with the flows and the automatic labels.
